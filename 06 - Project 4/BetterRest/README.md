The [project](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/betterrest-introduction):

> The actual app we’re building is called BetterRest, and it’s designed to help coffee drinkers
> get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:
>
> 1. When do they want to wake up?
> 2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
> 3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
> 
> Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed.
> If you think about it, there are billions of possible answers – all the various wake times multiplied by all the number of sleep hours, multiplied again by the full range of coffee amounts.
